title: The Elements
---

I was home sick yesterday. So annoying. Getting up and doing something in the
darkroom was out of the question. I had already spent three feverish hours the
day before, confusedly producing unspeakable garbage. I decided that if I was
going to produce any more, at least it must be harmlessly and inexpensively
perpetrated on the computer, in the comfort of this chair by the fire, with the
cat on my lap.

Well, for one thing, my child (seven years old) walks around singing Tom Lehrer
songs. He's a great fan of *Poisoning Pigeons in the Park* (awesome) and *The
Masochism Tango* (awesome?). He also likes *The Elements*, but the words are a
bit harder to master. Some weeks ago he began by singing, "There's arsenic,
aluminum, selenium, and bubble gum!", and his interest (and accuracy) has only
grown since then. I can hear him in the other room when he sings about thulium
and thallium, or gold and protactinium. It warms the heart on these cold winter
days.

And as for me, well, at my age, I still don't know the lyrics for a song I've
loved since I was not much older than he. When I was a kid, my best friend
Steven and I even went trick-or-treating at the Tom Lehrer's house. (Lehrer has
Steven's neighbor.) I remember how we stood dumb on his front porch when the
Great Man opened the door, so in awe were we of this genius whose records we
listened to over and over and over, lying on the floor in front of the record
player, surrounded by legos and mineral specimens. I remember him just looking
at us, smiling through his thick black glasses, while we stood there, clutching
our halloween bags, wanting to say something, but unable to speak. He was just
too awesome, in any sense of the word you like.

So there it is. Clearly, we need a way to learn the Elements song. So here's my
feeble attempt: [The Elements](https://github.com/jedp/The-Elements)

It plays Sir Arthur Sullivan's music while flashing Tom Lehrer's lyrics and
highlighting the elements in the periodic table as they are mentioned. It looks
like this as you go:

For pedagogical purposes, you can use the following key controls:

- Left arrow: Back up a bit
- Right arrow: Go forward a bit
- Up arrow: Go faster!
- Down arrow: Go slower. Oh well.
- Space bar: pause to breathe / resume the madness

This was my first try at in-browser audio, which I've been neglecting for way
too long. I found the brilliant supersynth "game", from which I have cribbed
unapologetically.

The core of the program uses audiolib.js and music.js.
